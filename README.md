# 5-in-1 Voice-Controlled Games

A collection of **five classic arcade-style games** developed in **C++ using SFML**, featuring a **voice-controlled input system** powered by Python.  
The project demonstrates real-time game mechanics, state management, and integration between gameplay systems and external input models.

A gameplay **showreel** is included to showcase voice-based interaction and in-game responsiveness.

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

This project explores an alternative input paradigm for games by replacing traditional keyboard controls with **voice commands**.  
Each game is fully playable using voice input, highlighting seamless coordination between the game loop and the voice recognition pipeline.

---

## ✨ Included Games

- Arkanoid
- Asteroid Shooter
- Doodle Jump
- Snake
- Xonix
- Each game supports voice-driven player actions and traditional game mechanics (movement, scoring, win/lose states)
- Unified input handling system across all games

---

## 🧠 Voice Control System

- Implemented a **Python-based voice recognition module**
- Processes spoken commands in real time
- Communicates with the C++ game layer to trigger gameplay actions
- Designed to be extensible for additional commands and games

---

## 🧱 Game Systems & Mechanics

Across the five games, the following systems were implemented:

- Core game loops and state management
- Physics and collision handling
- Sprite rendering and animation using SFML
- Score tracking and progression logic
- Input abstraction layer supporting voice commands

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Game Development:** C++, SFML
- **Voice Recognition:** Python
- **Integration:** Cross-language communication between Python and C++ modules

---

## ▶️ Showreel

The showreel demonstrates:
- Voice commands triggering in-game actions
- Responsiveness of the voice recognition system
- Gameplay flow across multiple games

> 📽️ See the included showreel for a visual demonstration of voice-controlled gameplay.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the Python environment for voice recognition
3. Build the C++ SFML games
4. Launch the voice recognition module
5. Run the selected game and play using voice commands

---

## 📝 Notes

- This project focuses on **input innovation and system integration**, not production-level voice accuracy.
- Voice commands are optimized for clarity and responsiveness in a controlled environment.
- Designed as a technical exploration of voice-driven gameplay.
